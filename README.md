## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This project utilizes a modern, Python-based stack to deliver a seamless experience, spanning from data processing to user interaction.

| Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | The core programming language for all application logic. |
| **Streamlit** | The framework used to build and serve the entire interactive web application and UI components. |
| **Pandas** | The backbone for all data operations: loading the CSV, data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis. |
| **Plotly** | The engine for creating beautiful, interactive, and data-rich visualizations like the pie, area, and Sankey charts. |
| **Scikit-learn** | Used for prototyping the underlying machine learning models for anomaly detection and other insights. |

## üîß The AI Advisor Workflow

The AI Advisor provides insights not from a single complex model, but through a series of targeted data analysis steps, mimicking how a financial analyst would work.

**`[transactions.csv]` ‚ûî `[Data Ingest]` ‚ûî `[Filtering & Grouping]` ‚ûî `[Statistical Analysis]` ‚ûî `[Conditional Logic]` ‚ûî `[Personalized Tip]`**

1.  **Data Ingest:** The advisor loads the current, up-to-date transaction data from the shared session state.
2.  **Filtering & Grouping:** It separates expenses from income and groups transactions by category and by month.
3.  **Statistical Analysis:** For each spending category, it calculates key statistics like the mean (average) and standard deviation of transaction amounts. It also calculates total spending for the current and previous months.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** The advisor checks for specific conditions:
    -   *Is one category's total spending significantly higher than others?*
    -   *Is any single transaction more than 2 standard deviations above the average for its category?*
    -   *Is this month's spending more than 10% higher or lower than last month's?*
5.  **Personalized Tip Generation:** Based on which conditions are met, it generates a formatted, easy-to-understand string with a `st.warning`, `st.error`, or `st.success` message, providing the user with actionable advice.
